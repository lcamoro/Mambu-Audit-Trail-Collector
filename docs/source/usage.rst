Mambu Audit Trail Collector for Splunk
======================================

Collecting audit data is a great way to correlate all kinds of information so that analysts and auditors will be able to retrieve the necessary information in a timely and efficient manner to investigate a potential fraud or other specific suspicious action.

With that in mind, the purpose of this Splunk Add-On is to bridge Mambu Audit Trail project to understand what the users are doing and how they are using the platform.



Check status/enable Audit Trail API Consumer
--------------------------------------------

To authenticate Audit Trail requests you must use an API key generated by an API consumer of the type 'audit trail'.  So, first of all (and the most important thing) is to check if the API Consumers and Audit Trail features are already enabled.

Go to Administration on the top menu bar and verify this.

If for some reason one of the features is disabled, you should contact Mambu support team.

**NOTE:** *Keep in mind that the audit events should be available for making request, as soon as one of the audited action occurs, e.g after a user logs in.*


Connection Troubleshooting
--------------------------

If you faced timeout issues from the Splunk client host, you'd probably need to validate the IP Whitelisting configuration in your tenant/environment.

To do that, you will need to check the following section: Administration > Access > Preferences, specifically the IP Access Restrictions configuration:
